# High-Tech-site1
High-Tech is a front-end website for online sales of technological equipment developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This scholarly project was a collaborative effort among three of my university colleagues. My main responsibilities included developing the JavaScript code for the entire site, including the wrapper game, the hole actualités page, and various other pages.
