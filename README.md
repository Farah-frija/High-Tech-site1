# High-Tech-site1
High-Tech is a front-end website for online sales of technological equipment developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This scholarly project was a collaborative effort among three of my university colleagues. My main responsibilities included developing the JavaScript code for the entire site, including the wrapper game, the hole actualit√©s page, and various other pages.
